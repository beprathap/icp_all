Task1: Created a method called reverseString and passed parameters InputString which contains actual string value and removechars contains the characters to be removed from the inputstring both of these can be given by the user. Defined a list to store the inputstring characters, outputstring variable to hold the final result and initialized a flag variable to 0, which is again reinitialized to 1 if character removed matches with any of the character in the actual string, once the characters are removed, the characters in the list are appended using the + operator. 

Task2: Two numbers are given by the user and the 4 arithmetic operations are performed in order and the result is printed on the console.

Task3: Declared a method called replaceWords which takes the string parameter. String variable contains the user input and used one of the string method here to replace the occurance of python with pythons.

Task4: Declared the marks variable to take input from the user and casting it to integer value and else if block to print the grade based on the marks given by the user.
