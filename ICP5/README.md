Which algorithm you got better accuracy? Can you justify why?
Ans:
* SVM is often unsuitable for large datasets, as our data is small compared to that svm outperformed Gaussian Naive Bayes.
* It usually does a better job as it is a large margin classifier.
* a linear kernel helps us do certain calculation faster which otherwise would involve computations in higher dimensional space
